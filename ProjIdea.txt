*Required technologies:
    /Backend:
        -Express.js as backend framework
        -MongoDBAtlas as database
    /Frontend:
        -Any frontend framework

*Assignment:
    - A table of users (can be added and removed, and so can the games) that when you hover over a user, you can see their profile, and their accumulated score.
    - Each user profile will contain their game catalog, how much each game is worth (arbitrary score given to each game), and their overall score based on said games.
    - The table will be sorted by score from highest to lowest.

*General outline:
